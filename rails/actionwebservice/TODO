= Low priority tasks
  - add better type mapping tests for XML-RPC
  - add tests for ActiveRecord support (with mock objects?)

= Refactoring
  - Find an alternative way to map interesting types for SOAP (like ActiveRecord
    model classes) that doesn't require creation of a sanitized copy object with data
    copied from the real one. Ideally this would let us get rid of
    ActionWebService::Struct altogether and provide a block that would yield the
    attributes and values. "Filters" ?  Not sure how to integrate with SOAP though.
  
  - Don't have clean way to go from SOAP Class object to the xsd:NAME type
    string -- NaHi possibly looking at remedying this situation
