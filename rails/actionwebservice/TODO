= Post-1.0
  - Add :rest dispatching mode, a.l.a. Backpack API. Clean up dispatching
    in general. Support vanilla XML-format as a "Rails" protocol?

  - Allow locking down a controller to only accept messages for a particular
    protocol.  This will allow us to generate fully conformant error messages
    in cases where we currently fudge it if we don't know the protocol.

  - Allow AWS user to participate in typecasting, so they can centralize
    workarounds for buggy input in one place
  
= Refactoring
  - Don't have clean way to go from SOAP Class object to the xsd:NAME type
    string -- NaHi possibly looking at remedying this situation
