= metaWeblog example


This example shows how one might begin to go about adding metaWeblog
(http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) API support to a Rails-based
blogging application.


= Running

  1. Ensure you have the 'actionservice' Gem installed. You can generate it using
     this command:

       $ rake package


  2. Edit config/environment.rb, and add the following line after the rest of the
     require_gem statements:

      require_gem 'actionservice'


  3. Copy blog_controller.rb to "app/controllers" in a Rails project.


  4. Fire up a desktop blogging application (such as BloGTK on Linux),
     point it at http://localhost:3000/blog/api, and try creating or
     editing blog posts.
