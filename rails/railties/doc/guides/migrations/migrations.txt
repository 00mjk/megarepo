Migrations
==========

Migrations are a convenient way for you to alter your database in a structured and organised manner. ActiveRecord takes care of working out which migrations have already been run so you can just update your source and run the migrations, leaving ActiveRecord to work out the details.

Migrations also allow you to describe these transformation using ruby, in a database independent way (you can drop down to raw SQL for database specific features).

Rails packages a number of rake tasks and generators for working with migrations and we'll talk about those too.
