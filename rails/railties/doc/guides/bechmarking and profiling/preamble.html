<div class="para"><p>You have successfully written a well tested ground breaking Social Marketing Network and have successfully deployed by Hand/Capistrano/Vlad to your shiny VPS. You are ready to go live after a few beta tests. But you're finding there is a problem. Everything was working wonderfully on your development setup, but now with fifty or a hundred people using your application at the same time things have slowed to a crawl. Pages are being dropped and mysql is giving people timeout errors. How are we going to fix this. It's time to Benchmark and Profile your application.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking and Profiling is an important part of the development process that is talked about nearly enough for most beginning developers. Its hard enough learning a language and successfully writing an application. But without a firm understanding optimization, production ready apps are a near impossibility. No matter how well you code, or how much you know about a language there is always something that will trip up your application.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This article is my attempt to give the basic knowledge and methodology needed to optimize your application as painlessly as possible. We are are attempting this on two fronts. Both as a straight explanation and also through a real example of how benchmarking can speed up an application.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>There are a lot of areas we need to cover so lets start.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="_terminology">Terminology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_what_we_mean_by_benchmarking_and_profiling">What We Mean by Benchmarking and Profiling</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking: Is a process that enables comparison of inputs, processes or outputs between institutions (or parts of institutions) or within a single institution over time.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Pretty blah right. If you are new to programing you probably have heard the term mostly in comparative reviews of computer and graphic card specs. If you done a bit of coding you've probably seen in mostly in terms of comparing one language to another or iterations of the same language.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Benchmarking in terms of rails is a bit more specific. It entails comparing and contrasting various parts and pages of an application against one another. Mostly one is looking for how long a page requires to render, but memory consumption is also an area of concern.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Profiling: When a page or process is seen to be problematic due to speed or memory consumption we profile it. Meaning we measures the behavior as the page or process runs, particularly the frequency and duration of function calls. The goal of profiling is not to find bugs, but to eliminate bottlenecks and establish a baseline for future regression testing. It must be engaged in a carefully controlled process of measurement and analysis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><strong>What does that actually mean?</strong></p></div>
<div class="para"><p>You have to have a clear goal for when you profile. It's very comparable to BDD where you are taking small steps towards a solution instead of trying to do it all in one large all encompassing step. A clearly defined set of expectations is essential for meaningful performance testing. For example, for a Web application, you need to know at least two things:
expected load in terms of concurrent users or HTTP connections and
acceptable response time.</p></div>
<h3 id="_where_does_this_leave_us">Where Does this Leave Us</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Numbers and data. You benchmark to compare, your profile to fix. It's all about gaining data to analyze and using that information to better your application. The most important thing you should take away at the moment that this must be done in a systematic way.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>So the next logical question is how do we get this data.</p></div>
</div>

</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>What concerns us here is the last line of the action.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Completed in 0.04310 (23 reqs/sec) gives us the amount of requests this specific action can handle.  0.04310 is the total amount of time the process to complete and 23 reqs/sec is an estimation from this. As we will see this number is not strictly valid since is a single instance of the process. But it does give you a general feel as to how the action is performing.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Rendering: 0.00819 (19%)  is the amount in milliseconds and the percentage of total time needed to complete the action for rendering the view</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>DB: 0.00757 (17%) is the amount in milliseconds and the percentage of total time needed to complete the action for querying the database</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Pretty easy right. But wait 17+19 equals 36. 36%! where  is the rest of the time going?  The rest of the time is being spent processing the controller. Which is usually what takes up the bulk of the action</p></div>
<h3 id="_why_the_log_file_on_it_s_own_is_not_helpful">Why the Log File on it's Own is not Helpful</h3>
<div class="para"><p>So why can't we just use this to test our rails application. Technically that could work, but would be very stressful and slow. You don't have time to view your log after every request to see if your code is running quickly. Also a request that runs 100 reqs/sec might simply be an outlier and really usually runs at 20 reqs/sec. It's simply not enough information to do everything we need it to do but it's a start.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>But there is something else we must consider.</p></div>
<h3 id="_a_simple_question_a_complicated_answer">A Simple Question, a Complicated Answer</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Is Completed in 0.04310 (23 reqs/sec) a good time. Seems like it doesn't it. 43 ms does not outrageous time for a dynamic page load. But is this a dynamic page load. Maybe it was all cached. In which case this is very slow. Or maybe I'm running on five year old equipment and this is actually blazing fast for my G3.  The truth is that we can't answer the question given the data. This is part of benchmarking. We need a baseline. Through comparative analysis of all your pages in your app, and an simple dynamic page for a control we can determine how fast your pages are actually running and if any of them need to be optimized.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>And now for something completely different a statistic lesson.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_a_lession_in_statistics">A Lession In Statistics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>Adapted from a blog Article by Zed Shaw. His rant is funnier but will take longer to read. &lt;br /&gt; <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/programmer_stats.html">Programmers Need To Learn Statistics Or I Will Kill Them All</a></p></div>
<h3 id="_why_learn_statistics">Why Learn Statistics</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Statistics is a hard discipline. One can study it for years without fully grasping all the complexities. But its a necessary evil for coders of every level to at least  know enough about statistics to know they know nothing about statistics. You can't optimize without it, and if you use it wrong, you'll just waste your time and the rest of your team's.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>You must always question your metrics and try to demolish your supposed reasoning.  Evidence and observation triumph over pure logic. Even the great Knuth once said: “Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”</p></div>
<h3 id="_power_of_ten_syndrome">Power-of-Ten Syndrome</h3>
<div class="para"><p>If you done any benchmarking you have probably heard
“All you need to do is run that test [insert power-of-ten] times and then do an average.”</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>For newbs this whole power of ten comes about because we need enough data to minimize the results being contaminated by outliers. If you loaded a page five times with three of those times being around 75ms and twice 250ms you have no way of knowing the real average processing time for you page. But if we take a 1000 times and 950 are 75ms and 50 are 250ms we have a much clearer picture of the situation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>But this still begs the question of how you determine that 1000 is the correct number of iterations to improve the power of the experiment? (Power in this context basically means the chance that your experiment is right.)</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The first thing that needs to be determined is how you are performing the samplings? 1000 iterations run in a massive sequential row? A set of 10 runs with 100 each? The statistics are different depending on which you do, but the 10 runs of 100 each would be a better approach. This lets you compare sample means and figure out if your repeated runs have any bias. More simply put, this allows you to see if you have a many or few outliers that might be poisoning your averages.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Another consideration is if a 1000 transactions is enough to get the process into a steady state after the ramp-up period? A common element of process control statistics is that all processes have a period in the beginning where the process isn’t stable. This “ramp-up” period is usually discarded when doing the analysis unless your run length has to include it. Most people think that 1000 is more than enough, but it totally depends on how the system functions. Many complex interacting systems can easily need 1000 iterations to get to a steady state, especially if performing 1000 transactions is very quick. Imagine a banking system that handles 10,000 transactions a second. I could take a good minute to get this system into a steady state, but your 1000 transaction test is only scratching the surface.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We can demonstrate this through R Code with similar means but different deviations.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note: R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.</p></div>
<div class="exampleblock">

<pre><tt>a &lt;- rnorm(100, 30, 5)
b &lt;- rnorm(100, 30, 20)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>I construct two sets of 100 random samples from the normal distribution. Now, if I just take the average (mean or median) of these two sets they seem almost the same:</p></div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example: Means of Sample</div>

<div class="colist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
mean(a)

<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
median(b)
 31.06874
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>They’re both around 30. So all good right? Not quite. If one looks at the outliers a different story emerges.</p></div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example: Summary Output</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="colist"><ol>
<li>
<p>

</p>

<p>

 -15.48   16.90   31.07   30.12   43.42   80.86
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>They aren't so similar now are they. Averages don't tell you everything. In fact in some cases they tell you almost nothing.</p></div>
<h3 id="_don_t_just_use_averages">Don't Just Use Averages!</h3>
<div class="para"><p>One cannot simply say my website “[insert power-of-ten] requests per second”. This is due to it being an Average. Without some form of range or variance error they are useless.  Two averages can be the same, but hide massive differences in behavior. Without a standard deviation it’s not possible to figure out if the two might even be close. An even better approach (with normally distributed data) is to use a Student’s t-test to see if there are differences.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note: A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic has a Student's t distribution if the null hypothesis is true. It is applied when the population is assumed to be normally distributed but the sample sizes are small enough that the statistic on which inference is based is not normally distributed because it relies on an uncertain estimate of standard deviation rather than on a precisely known value. #TODO simply this to something I and the rest of the world will actually understand.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Let’s look at the standard deviation for our two samples:</p></div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example: Standard Deviation</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="colist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
sd(a)
 5.562842
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
sd(b)
[1] 19.09167
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
</div></div>
<div class="para"><p>Stability is vastly different for these two samples If this were a web server performance run I’d say the second server (represented by b) has a major reliability problem. No, it’s not going to crash, but it’s performance response is so erratic that you’d never know how long a request would take. Even though the two servers perform the same on average, users will think the second one is slower because of how it seems to randomly perform.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The moral of the story is that if you give an average without standard deviations then you’re totally missing the entire point of even trying to measure something. A major goal of measurement is to develop a succinct and accurate picture of what’s going on, but if you don’t find out the standard deviation and do at least a couple graphs then you are not gaining anything from the process. There are other thing though that you must be aware of when testing your system. A big one is Confounding</p></div>
<h3 id="_confounding">Confounding</h3>
<div class="para"><p>The idea of confounding is pretty simple: If you want to measure something, then don’t measure anything else.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>An example. Imagine that someone tried to tell you that you needed to compare a bunch of flavors of ice cream for their taste, but that half of the tubs of creamy goodness were melted, and half were frozen. Do you think having to slop down a gallon of Heath Crunch flavored warm milk would skew your quality measurement? Of course it would. The temperature of the ice cream is confounding your comparison of taste quality. In order to fix the problem you need to remove this confounding element by having all the ice cream at a constant temperature.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>#TODO add more information in how to avoid confounding.</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Your testing system and your production system must be separate. You can't profile on the same system because you are using resources to run the test that your server should be using to serve the requests.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="_define_what_you_are_measuring">Define what you are Measuring</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Before you can measure something you really need to lay down a very concrete definition of what you’re measuring. You should also try to measure the simplest thing you can and try to avoid confounding.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The most important thing to determine though is how much data you can actually send to your application through it's pipe.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>That’s all there is to performance measurement. Sure, “how much”, “data”, and “pipe” all depend on the application, but if you need 1000 requests/second processing mojo, and you can’t get your web server to push out more than 100 requests/second, then you’ll never get your JSP+EJB+Hibernate+SOAP application anywhere near good enough. If all you can shove down your DS3 is 10k/second then you’ll never get that massive 300k flash animation to your users in time to sell them your latest Gizmodo 9000.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>So what do these columns tell us:</p></div>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
%self - The percentage of time spent processing the method. This is derived from self_time/total_time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
total - The time spent in this method and its children.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
self - The time spent in this method.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
wait - Time processed was queued
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
child - The time spent in this method's children.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
calls - The number of times this method was called.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
name - The name of the method.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>Name can be displayed three seperate ways:
        <strong> #toplevel - The root method that calls all other methods
        </strong> MyObject#method - Example Hash#each, The class Hash is calling the method each
        * &lt;Object:MyObject&gt;#test - The &lt;&gt; characters indicate a singleton method on a singleton class. Example &lt;Class::Object&gt;#allocate</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods are sorted based on %self. Hence the ones taking the most time and resources will be at the top.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>So for Array#each which is calling each on the class array. We find that it processing time is 2% of the total and was called 15 times. The rest of the information is 0.00 because the process is so fast it isn't recording times less then 100 ms.</p></div>

<h3 id="_the_analysis_process">The Analysis Process</h3>
<div class="para"><p>I’m going to give an example methodology for conducting your benchmarking and profiling on an application. It is based on your typical scientific method.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>For something as complex as Benchmarking you need to take any methodology with a grain of salt but there are some basic strictures that you can depend on.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Formulate a question you need to answer which is simple, tests the smallest measurable thing possible, and is exact. This is typically the hardest part of the experiment. From there some steps that you should follow are.</p></div>

<li>
<p>
Develop a set of variables and processes to measure in order to answer this question!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Profile based on the question and variables. Key problems to avoid when designing this experiment are:
</p>
<div class="ilist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Confounding: Test one thing at a time, keep everything the same so you don't poison the data with uncontrolled processes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Cross Contamination: Make sure that runs from one test do not harm the other tests.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Steady States: If you’re testing long running process. You must take the ramp up time and performance hit into your initial measurements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sampling Error: Data should perform have a steady variance or range. If you get wild swings or sudden spikes, etc. then you must either account for the reason why or you have a sampling error.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Measurement Error: Aka Human error, always go through your calculations at least twice to make sure there are no mathematical errors. .
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do a small run of the experiment to verify the design.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use the small run to determine a proper sample size.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Run the test.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Perform the analysis on the results and determine where to go from there.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note: Even though we are using the typical scientific method; developing a hypothesis is not always useful in terms of profiling. The argument against using an hypothesis is that it will influence your experimental design and doesn’t really prove anything.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>NOTE! You can only set the SyslogLogger program name when you initialize SyslogLogger for the first time.
